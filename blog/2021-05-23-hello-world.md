Welcome to our project! You are here so we assume you are familiar with [Raid Guild](https://raidguild.org/) and Web3. Based on that assumption you are in the world of crypto and it has been a difficult week. We don't have the answers and these words won't change how you feel. What is important is for you to take inventory of those feelings. The losses we endure provide valuable lessons. Consider what you did wrong and how you might approach things differently next time.

**There will be a next time!**

We are just getting started. We are the early adopters. We are the ones slicing through the jungle with a machete. And we will have the scars to prove it.

When the hype and speculation die down is when the buidlers get to work. And that is exactly what we are doing. The recent crash just happened to coincide with the kick off of Raid Guild Season 1. Season 1 is a cohort of apprentices learning the ways of the DAO.

During the onboarding process we have split into teams so slay various demons. Our group choose to figure out how to create a W3 marketing site template. This could be any easy to spin-up site for DAOs, NFTs and DeFi protocols.

We have narrowed in on DAOs as our early adopters and are exploring the path to least resistance for getting a [Docusaurus](https://docusaurus.io/) site deployed on [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/). Our project is the site you are currently on. Through this process we hope to get a better understanding of what is required to help you launch your next idea!
